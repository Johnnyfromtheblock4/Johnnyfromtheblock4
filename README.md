## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Simone Visconti and I'm a web develpoer. I changed my life a year ago and decided to start learnging coding. I'm currently studying HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, NODE, EXPRESS and SQL, but I still have a long way to go! I love coding cause is like bringing words to reality! Can't wait to be a good dev and helping the world to be a better/smarter place!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new start-up called Syndicore, the main project is still a secret ðŸ¤«
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Crypto Chains and I've just done a film review website that you can check out [here](https://opus-movies.netlify.app/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate any cool ideas!
  - ðŸ“§ Send me enquire at simone.visconti4@gmail.com
